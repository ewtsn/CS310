// Bianca is preparing special dishes for her daughterâ€™s birthday.
// It takes her "a" minutes to prepare the first dish, and each following dish takes "b" minutes longer than the previous dish.
// She has "t" minutes to prepare the dishes.
// For example, if the first dish takes a = 10 minutes and b = 5, then the second dish will take 15 minutes, the third dish will take 20 minutes, and so on.
// If she has 80 minutes to prepare the dishes, then she can prepare four dishes because 10 + 15 + 20 + 25 = 70.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the values of a, b, and t, and outputs the number of dishes Bianca can prepare.
